summary: One kernel scenario

description: |
  Test the edge-case scenario where the installed
  kernel is the same version as the one in enabled RHEL repositories.
  The RHEL repositories contain only this one kernel. The test verifies
  that C2R is able to replace the installed kernel with the RHEL one correctly.
