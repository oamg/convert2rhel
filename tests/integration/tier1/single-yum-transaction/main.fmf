summary: Verify the single yum transaction

description: |
    Handle the unified yum transactions so that it handles packages without
    error. Previous iterations used a lot of different steps, whereas now it is
    one transaction that can be rolled back more easily.

    Verify that packages got upgraded by the end of conversion instead of
    reinstalled/downgraded.
