    Running conversion when firewalld is running and the proper configuration option is used.
description: |
    Verify that on the OL8.8 the conversion does not break when
    firewalld is running and the the `CleanupModulesOnExit` configuration
    option is set to `no` in firewalld configuration file. If the option is not
    set then the conversion would end up with a broken machine.
    This only applies to Oracle Linux (>=) 8.8.
