    Verify, that a warning message is printed out to the user in case
    the tool can't detect the initramfs and vmlinuz files in /boot.

    This case can happen if the kernel scriptlet fails during the yum/dnf
    transaction where Convert2RHEL tries to replace the packages. Even though
    the scriptlet can fail, the transaction will still continue and the
    workflow will continue to be executed. The problem is that, with a
    scriptlet failure when replacing/installing a kernel, the initramfs and
    vmlinuz may not be available in the /boot partition, especially if there
    isn't sufficient disk space available in there. This test has the intention
