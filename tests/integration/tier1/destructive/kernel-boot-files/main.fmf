    Handle kernel boot files issues

description: |
    Verify that Convert2RHEL can detect and handle the kernel boot files in
    case of failure.
    Verify that, if present, the kernel boot files are not corrupted.

    In any case, the conversion should not be inhibited. A warning will be
    shown to the user with instructions on how to fix it.

        Corrupted initramfs file
    description+: |
        Verify, that a warning message is printed out to the user in case of a corrupted initramfs file.
        This case can happen when the transaction is run successfully, due to the lack of
        a disk space in the /boot partition, the kernel scriptlet will fail to copy
        the uncompressed initramfs file to /boot/initramfs-*.img, thus, leaving the
        file in a partial state and corrupted.
    test: pytest -svv -m test_handle_corrupted_initramfs_file

/missing_kernel_boot_files:
    summary+: |
        Missing kernel boot files in /boot
    description+: |
        Verify, that a warning message is printed out to the user in case
        the tool can't detect the initramfs and vmlinuz files in /boot.
        This case can happen if the kernel scriptlet fails during the yum/dnf
        transaction where Convert2RHEL tries to replace the packages. Even though
        the scriptlet can fail, the transaction will still continue and the
        workflow will continue to be executed. The problem is that, with a
        scriptlet failure when replacing/installing a kernel, the initramfs and
        vmlinuz may not be available in the /boot partition, especially if there
        isn't sufficient disk space available in there. This test has the intention
        to verify that the warning with the correct steps are provided to the
        user in order to overcome this case and fix it for them.
    test: pytest -svv -m test_missing_kernel_boot_files
