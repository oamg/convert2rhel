description+: |
    Verify that it's possible to run the full conversion with older kernel,
    than available in the RHEL repositories.
        1/ Install older kernel on the system
        2/ Make sure the `CONVERT2RHEL_SKIP_KERNEL_CURRENCY_CHECK` is in place
            * doing that we also verify, the deprecated envar is still allowed
        3/ Enable *just* the rhel-7-server-rpms repository
        4/ Run conversion verifying the conversion is not inhibited and completes successfully
