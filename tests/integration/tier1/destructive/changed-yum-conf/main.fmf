summary: Change yum configuration file

description: |
    Test a scenario in which the user modifies /etc/yum.conf
    before the conversion. In that case, the config file does not get replaced
    during the conversion with the config file from the RHEL package.
    Make sure that C2R patches the config file
    and verify that the yum works after a successful conversion.
