summary: Remove packages from CentOS 8.5
description: |
    Verify that Convert2RHEL can handle correctly the package removal from the
    excluded list that is listed under the configuration files. This test
    calls an ansible playbook to install the packages that needs to be removed,
    and then, calls the integration tests that first assert that those packages
    exists, and proceeds to the conversion.
