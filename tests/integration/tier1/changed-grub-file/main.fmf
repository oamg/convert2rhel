summary: Change the grub file

description: |
    Modify the /etc/default/grub file with both 'valid' and 'invalid' changes.
    Valid changes are represented by adding newlines, whitespaces and comments.
    None of these should cause the `grub-mkfile` call to fail.
    Invalid changes, e.g. removing the `=` should cause the 'grub2-mkfile' call to fail.
    Verify a correct output of the call and a successful conversion.
