summary: Change yum configuration file

description: |
    Test the scenario in which the user modifies /etc/yum.conf
    before the conversion. In that case, during the conversion,
    the config file does not get replaced with the config file
    from the RHEL package. Make sure that C2R patch the config file
    and verify that the yum works after a successful conversion.
