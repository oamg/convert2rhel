    """Test yum distro-sync command edge-cases when given packages aren't in enabled repositories.

    Following is done:
        1) Install a problematic package (cpaste) - done in preparation step
        2) Run the conversion
        3) Run the distro-sync in two variants
            - just with the problematic package
            - with some another package, which is in RHEL repositories
        4) Do the same checks and conditions as is in convert2rhel/pkghandler.py in call_yum_cmd_w_downgrades.

    Another problem is, that yum behaves differently on Centos 7 and Centos 8
        - on Centos 7 returns 0 and any error in both cases
        - on Centos 8  returns 0 and any error if in list of packages for distro-sync is at least
          one, which can be successfully distro synced. If all of the given cannot be synced, there
          is an error, which caused problems: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OAMG-4600. But
          the error isn't in fact error, the package stays there
          and just isn't supported by Red Hat.
