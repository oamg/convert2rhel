    Test that verifies that having httpd installed is not causing transaction error.
description: |
    The yum transaction error happened when some packages depends on each
    other. When a package had dependency on some excluded package (like centos-logos)
    which was removed during the conversion then the package had missing dependency.
    If reinstall of some package happens that brings those dependencies into the transaction
    the error was raised. The problem was mostly caused by the httpd package installed on the
    system.
