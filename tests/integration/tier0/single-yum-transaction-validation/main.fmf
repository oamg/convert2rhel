summary: |
    Single yum transaction validation

description: |
    Verify that we are doing a proper rollback during the validation phase in
    our transactions.
    If any errors occurs during the transaction resolution, either by
    downloading a package, dependency resolver and etc., the rollback should
    start and revert the changes to the system.
    We simulate the error by removing the entitlement certs found at /etc/pki/entitlement
    at a specific times during the transaction validation.
