/custom_repos_conversion:
    summary: |
        Custom repositories conversion method
    description: |
        Conversion method with disabled subscription manager/RHSM and enabled 'custom' repositories.
        Usually we use the RHSM to enable the repositories `rhel-$releasever-server`.
        In this case we disable the RHSM and we need to provide our choice of repositories to be enabled.
        The repositories enabled in this scenario are
        {rhel7: [server rpms, extras rpms, optional rpms], rhel8: [[eus-]?baseos], [eus-]?appstream}.
