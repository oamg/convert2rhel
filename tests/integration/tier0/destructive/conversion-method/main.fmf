/custom_repos_conversion:
    summary: |
        Custom repositories conversion method
    description: |
        Conversion method with disabled subscription manager/RHSM and enabled 'custom' repositories.
        Usually we use the RHSM to enable the repositories `rhel-$releasever-server`.
        In this case we disable the RHSM and we need to provide our choice of repositories to be enabled.
        The repositories enabled in this scenario are
        {rhel7: [server rpms, extras rpms, optional rpms], rhel8: [[eus-]?baseos], [eus-]?appstream}.

/rhsm_eus_account_conversion:
    summary: |
        RHSM EUS conversion method
    description: |

        Satellite conversion method
    description: |
        Conversion method using the Satellite credentials for registration.
        The subscription-manager package is removed for this conversion method.
        Use the provided curl command to download the registration script to a file,
        then run the registration script file.
