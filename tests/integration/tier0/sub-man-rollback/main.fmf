summary: Rollback of the removed sub-man packages
description: |
    When the subscription-manager package is installed from the BaseOS repository prior to running convert2rhel, it is
    removed during the conversion run. This test makes sure that subscription-manager and its dependencies are correctly
    backed up and re-installed during the rollback together with the certificate.
