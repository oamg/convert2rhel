        Test verifying correct behavior when converting EUS candidates.
        EUS_MINOR_VERISONS mapping in convert2rhel/systeminfo.py is modified to mock the different scenarios.
        Verified scenarios (handled by pytest parametrization):
        1/ The system is considered as a non-EUS. This is done by removing the 8.8 version from the mapping file
            (note that this workaround works only on 8.8 systems).
            The --eus option is used in the command. Only regular (non-eus) repoids should be enabled.
        2/ The start date of the EUS phase is set far to the future to simulate the EUS phase
            did not start yet.
            The --eus option *is not used* and regular repoids enablement is expected.
        3/ The start date of the EUS phase is set far to the future to simulate the EUS phase
            did not start yet.
            The --eus option *is used* and EUS repoids enablement is expected.
        4/ The start date of the EUS phase is set far to the past to simulate the EUS phase began.
            The --eus option *is used*.
            The report is expected to print out a WARNING and advise to use the --eus option.

        to RHEL EUS minor versions (8.6, ...) and the --eus option is provided. The regular repositories
        should be enabled.
