    Verify the EUS releases are treated correctly

    Test verifying correct behavior when converting EUS candidates.
    EUS_MINOR_VERISONS mapping in convert2rhel/systeminfo.py is modified to mock the different scenarios.
    Verified scenarios (handled by pytest parametrization):
    1/ The system is considered as a non-EUS. This is done by removing the 8.8 version from the mapping file
        (note that this workaround works only on 8.8 systems).
        The --eus option is used in the command. Only regular (non-eus) repoids should be enabled.
    2/ The start date of the EUS phase is set far to the future to simulate the EUS phase
        did not start yet.
        The --eus option *is not used* and regular repoids enablement is expected.
    3/ The start date of the EUS phase is set far to the future to simulate the EUS phase
        did not start yet.
        The --eus option *is used* and EUS repoids enablement is expected.
    4/ The start date of the EUS phase is set far to the past to simulate the EUS phase began.
        The --eus option *is used*.
        The report is expected to print out a WARNING and advise to use the --eus option.
