    description+: |
        Verify that the yumdownloader output in the backup packages task is parsed correctly.
        In this scenario the yum-plugin-local was causing that excluded packages were not detected as downlaoded during
        a backup. Then, the removed excluded packages were not installed back during a rollback (RHELC-1272).
        Verify the utility handles both - packages downloaded for the backup
        and packages already existing in the backup directory.
