    summary+: |
        Subscription manager handled during rollback
    description+: |
        When the subscription-manager package is installed from the BaseOS repository prior to running convert2rhel, it is
        removed during the conversion run. This test makes sure that subscription-manager and its dependencies are correctly
        backed up and re-installed during the rollback together with the certificate.

            The convert2rhel won't unregister the system
        description+: |
            This test verifies that running conversion on pre-registered system won't unregister the system.
            1. Install subscription-manager, download the SSL certificate
            2. Register with subscription-manager and attach a subscription using the pool
            (both handled by the pre_registered fixture)
            3. Run convert2rhel without provided credentials
            4. Exit at the point of no return.
            5. Verify that convert2rhel won't unregister the system at any point and the UUID is same before and after the run.

            without an attached subscription will try auto attaching the subscription.
