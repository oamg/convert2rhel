    Handling file backup and restore

description+: |
    This test verifies correct handling of backup and restore of config files.
    "/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg", "/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf",
    "/etc/logrotate.d/yum" and "/etc/logrotate.d/dnf" are in scope of this test.
    The following scenarios are verified:
    1/  The config files are modified with additional data
        The contents are compared pre- and post-conversion analysis task
        and should remain the same.
    2/  The config files are removed pre-conversion analysis task
        and should remain absent post-rollback.
    Additionally, validates that a file clash does not happen during a backup.
    There was a clash happening in the way convert2rhel backups files,
    if there is a file to back up that has the same name as one directory
    or another file already created, an error will be thrown to the user.
    For that scenario we utilize "/etc/logrotate.d/yum"
    and "/etc/logrotate.d/yum" files.
