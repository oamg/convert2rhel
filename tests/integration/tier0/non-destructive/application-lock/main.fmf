        Verify that running convert2rhel locks out other instances.
        Additionally validate that the logfile did not get overwritten by the second invocation's output.
        1/ Invoke convert2rhel, wait on data collection acknowledgement prompt.
        2/ Invoke second instance of convert2rhel, observe warning and the utility exit.
        3/ Exit the first run of convert2rhel.
        4/ Validate that the logfile did not get overwritten by the second invocation's output.
        5/ Invoke third instance of convert2rhel; with the previous instances dead, the third instance should be allowed to run.
        6/ Exit the utility on the first prompt.
