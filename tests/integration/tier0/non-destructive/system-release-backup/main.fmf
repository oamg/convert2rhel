        Restore the os-release file during rollback
    description+: |
        We remove all the system repositories from the usual location.
        Since the host is registered through Satellite having access only to the RHEL repositories,
        convert2rhel is unable to perform back-up of some packages.
        Set the "CONVERT2RHEL_SKIP_KERNEL_CURRENCY_CHECK" envar to bypass kernel check.
        Verify that the /etc/os-release file is restored after the rollback.

            os-release restored without CONVERT2RHEL_INCOMPLETE_ROLLBACK
        description+: |
            In this scenario the variable `CONVERT2RHEL_INCOMPLETE_ROLLBACK` is not set, therefore
            using analyze we expect convert2rhel to raise an error and return code 2.

            os-release restored with CONVERT2RHEL_INCOMPLETE_ROLLBACK
        description+: |
            In this scenario the variable `CONVERT2RHEL_INCOMPLETE_ROLLBACK` is set.
            Note that after the test, the $releasever variable is unset.
            That is due to the incomplete rollback not being able to back up/restore the *-linux-release
            package, the issue gets resolved by the (auto used) `workaround_missing_os_release_package` fixture.
