            We remove all the system repositories from the usual location.
            Since the host is registered through Satellite having access only to the RHEL repositories,
            convert2rhel is unable to perform back-up of some packages.
            Set the "CONVERT2RHEL_SKIP_KERNEL_CURRENCY_CHECK" envar to bypass kernel check.
            Verify that the /etc/os-release file is restored after the rollback.

            description+: |
                In this scenario the variable `CONVERT2RHEL_INCOMPLETE_ROLLBACK` is not set, therefore
                using analyze we expect convert2rhel to raise an error and return code 1.

                Note that after the test, the $releasever variable is unset.
                That is due to the incomplete rollback not being able to back up/restore the *-linux-release
                package, the issue gets resolved by the (autoused) missing_os_release_package_workaround fixture.
