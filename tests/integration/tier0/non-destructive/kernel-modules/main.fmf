        Unsupported kernel module

        One kernel module is moved to a custom location,
        therefore denoted as custom by the running system.

        description+: |
            This test verifies that rpmquery for detecting supported kernel modules in RHEL works correctly.
            If custom module is loaded the conversion has to raise:
            ENSURE_KERNEL_MODULES_COMPATIBILITY.UNSUPPORTED_KERNEL_MODULES.

            This test verifies that setting the environment variable "CONVERT2RHEL_ALLOW_UNAVAILABLE_KMODS"
            will override the check error when there is an kernel module unavailable in RHEL detected.
            The environment variable is set through the test metadata.
