    Load kernel module that is not supported in RHEL and verify the utility works as expected.
    Verify that removing this kmod does not interfere with new conversion run.
    Verify that loading custom kernel module, that marks the kernel as "tainted",
    raises an error during the conversion.

        Custom kernel module
    description+:
        One kernel module is moved to a custom location,
        therefore denoted as custom by the running system.

        summary+: |
            Load custom kernel module
        description+: |
            This test verifies that rpmquery for detecting supported kernel modules in RHEL works correctly.
            If custom module is loaded the conversion has to raise:
            ENSURE_KERNEL_MODULES_COMPATIBILITY.UNSUPPORTED_KERNEL_MODULES.

            Load the kmod from custom location.
            Verify that it is loaded.
            Remove the previously loaded 'custom' kmod and verify, the conversion
            does not raise the ENSURE_KERNEL_MODULES_COMPATIBILITY.UNSUPPORTED_KERNEL_MODULES.
            The kmod compatibility check is right before the point of no return.
            Abort the conversion right after the check.

            This test verifies that setting the environment variable "CONVERT2RHEL_ALLOW_UNAVAILABLE_KMODS"
            will override the check error when there is RHEL unsupported kernel module detected.
            The environment variable is set through the test metadata.

        In this test case we force load kmod and verify that the convert2rhel raises:
        TAINTED_KMODS.TAINTED_KMODS_DETECTED.
        Force loaded kmods are denoted (FE) where F = module was force loaded E = unsigned module was loaded.
        Convert2RHEL sees force loaded kmod as tainted.

        This test marks the kernel as tainted which is not supported by convert2rhel.
