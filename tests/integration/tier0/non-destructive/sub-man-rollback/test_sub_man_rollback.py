    Verify that convert2rhel removes and backs up the original vendor subscription-manager packages, including
    python3-syspurpose and python3-cloud-what which are also built out of the subscription-manager SRPM.

    Not removing and backing up the python3-syspurpose and python3-cloud-what packages on CentOS Linux 8.5 was causing
    a rollback failure when an older version of these two packages was installed.

    The rollback failure caused the following issues during the subsequent second run of convert2rhel:
    1. when the rollback happened before removing the centos-linux-release package, the removed
      subscription-manager-rhsm-certificates was not re-installed back during the rollback leading to a missing
      /etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem file which is necessary for accessing the official convert2rhel repo on CDN
      (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELC-744)
    2. when the rollback happened before removing the centos-linux-release package, this package was not re-installed
      back during the rollback and that lead to the $releasever variable being undefined, ultimately causing a traceback
      when using the DNF python API (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELC-762)
