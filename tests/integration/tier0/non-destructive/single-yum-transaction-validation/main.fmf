    Single yum transaction validation

description: |
    Verify that we are doing a proper rollback during the validation phase in
    our transactions.
    If any errors occurs during the transaction resolution, either by
    downloading a package, dependency resolver and etc., the rollback should
    start and revert the changes to the system.
    We simulate the error by removing the entitlement certs found at /etc/pki/entitlement
    at a specific times during the transaction validation.

        Unhandled exception for packages with in name period
    description+: |
        This test verifies that packages with period in their name are parsed correctly.
        1/ Install problematic packages with period in name using packages_with_period fixture.
            E.g. python3.11-3.11.2-2.el8.x86_64 java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless-1.8.0.372.b07-4.el8.x86_64
        2/ Run conversion and expect no issues with the transaction validation.
            If there are issues with the Unhandled exception was caught: too many values to unpack (expected 2),
            raise AssertionError.
        3/ End the conversion at the Point of no return

    summary+: |
        Override exclude in yum config to avoid dependency problems
    description+: |
        This test verifies that packages that are defined in the exclude
        section in the /etc/yum.conf file are ignored during the analysis and
        conversion.
        The reason for us to ignore those packages, is that a user could
        specify something like 'redhat-release-server' in the exclude list, and
        that would cause dependency problems in the transaction.

        1/ Add the exclude section to /etc/yum.conf with the
            redhat-release-server package specified
        2/ Set the environment variable to skip kernel check
        3/ Boot into an older kernel
        4/ Run the analysis and check that the transaction was successful.
