    Load kernel module that is not supported in RHEL and verify the utility works as expected.
    Verify, that removing this kmod does not interfere with new conversion run.
    Verify that loading custom kernel module, that marks the kernel as "tainted", inhibits the conversion.

        One kernel module is moved to a custom location,
        therefore denoted as custom by the running system.

            This test verifies that rpmquery for detecting supported kernel modules in RHEL works correctly.
            If custom module is loaded the conversion has to be inhibited.

            Load the kmod from custom location.

            Remove the previously loaded 'custom' kmod and verify, the conversion is not inhibited.
            The kmod compatibility check is right before the point of no return.
            Abort the conversion right after the check.

            will override the inhibition when there is RHEL unsupported kernel module detected.
            The environment variable is set through the test metadata.

        Force load a kernel module
    description+: |
        In this test case we force load kmod and verify that the convert2rhel run is inhibited.
        Force loaded kmods are denoted (FE) where F = module was force loaded E = unsigned module was loaded.
        convert2rhel handles force loaded kmod as tainted.

    description+: |
        This test marks the kernel as tainted which is not supported by convert2rhel.
        We need to install specific kernel packages to build own custom kernel module.
        Verify the conversion is inhibited.
