%description
The purpose of the convert2rhel tool is to provide an automated way of
converting the installed other-than-RHEL OS distribution to Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL). The tool replaces all the original OS-signed packages with the
RHEL ones. Available are conversions of CentOS Linux 7/8, Oracle Linux 7/8
and Scientific Linux 7 to the respective major version of RHEL.
