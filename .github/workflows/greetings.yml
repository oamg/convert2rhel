            ## **Thank you for contributing to the Convert2RHEL project!**
            ðŸ‘‹ Hello @${{ github.actor }}, thank you for submitting a PR ðŸš€!
            Please note that every PR needs to comply with the [Convert2RHEL Guidelines](https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and must pass all tests in order to be mergable.
            If you want to rebuild a package in copr, you can use following commands as a comment:
            - **/packit copr-build** to trigger a copr build using packit

            To launch regression testing public members of oamg organization don't need any extra step. The automation kicks that off for you!

            If you're an external collaborator (Meaning that you're not part of oamg), ping the `@oamg/convert2rhel-developers` group to assign the testing label to your pr.

            Please [open ticket](https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/issues) in case you experience technical problem with the CI.

            **Note:** In case there are problems with tests not being triggered automatically on new PR/commit or pending for a long time, please tag `@oamg/convert2rhel-developers` in the pr comments.
