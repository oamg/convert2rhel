    Pexpect.spawn class that can set terminal size before starting process.

    This class is a workaround to the fact that pexpect-2.3 cannot officially set the terminal size
    until after the process is started.  On RHEL7, we use pexpect 2.3 along with yumdownloader.
    yundownloader checks the terminal size when it starts and then uses that terminal size for
    printing out its progress lines even if the size changes later.  This causes output to be
    truncated (losing information about the downloaded packages) because the line would be longer
    than the 80 columns which pexpect.spawn hardcodes as the startup value.

    Modern versions of pexpect (from 2015) fix this by giving spawn a dimensions() argument to set
    the startup terminal size.  We can emulate this by overriding the setwindowsize() function in
    a subclass through the use of a big kludge:

    pexpect-2.3's __init__() calls setwindowsize() to set the initial terminal size. If we
    override setwindowsize() to hardcode the dimensions that we pass in to the subclass's
    constructor prior to calling the base class's __init__(), pexpect will end up calling our
    overridden setwindowsize(), making the terminal the size that we want. If we then revert
    setwindowsize() back to the real function prior to returning from the subclass's __init__(),
    user's of the returned spawn object won't know that we temporarily overrode that method.

    .. warning:: unittests which utilize this may fail on pexpect-2.3 (RHEL7) unless capfd
