convert2rhel is not currently localized but it does interact with other systems which are. this
module provides a single place to keep that information.  If we decide to localize convert2rhel in
the future, this file should point us towards all the locations that we may need to change.

# Subscription-manager's DBus API has its own method to set the locale. I'm not sure whether we
# would want these to obey the Display locale of the programming locale. We're likely to forward
# the error messages on to the user so display locale feels like the best fit but sometimes error
# messages are best left un-localized so that they are easier to perform a web-search for.
# We can make a decision if/when we're ready to localize convert2rhel.
