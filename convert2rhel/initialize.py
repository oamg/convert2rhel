    We need to initialize the root logger with the NullHandler before dbus is
    imported. Otherwise, dbus will install Handlers on the root logger which
    can end up printing our log messages an additional time.  Additionally,
    bad user data could end up causing the dbus logging to log rhsm passwords

def set_locale():

    Set the C locale, also known as the POSIX locale, for the main process as well as the child processes.

    The reason is to get predictable output from the executables we call, not
    influenced by non-default locale. We need to be setting not only LC_ALL
    and LANGUAGE but LANG as well because subscription-manager considers LANG
    to have priority over LC_ALL even though it goes against POSIX which
    specifies that LC_ALL overrides LANG.

    .. note::
        Since we introduced a new way to interact with packages that is not
        through the `yum` cli calls, but with the Python API, we had to move
        this function to a new module to initialize all the settings in
        Convert2RHEL before-hand as this was causing problems related to the
        locales. The main problem that this function solves by being here is by
        overriding any user set locale in their machine, to actually being the
        ones we require during the process execution.
