    The basic interface to this is a LIFO stack.  When a Restorable is pushed
    onto the stack, it is backed up.  When it is popped off of the stack, it is
    restored.  Changes are restored in the reverse order that that they were
    added.  Changes cannot be retrieved and restored out of order.
