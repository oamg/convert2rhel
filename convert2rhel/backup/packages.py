    """Install a set of packages in a way that they can be uninstalled later.

    .. warn:: This functionality is incomplete (These are things that need cleanup)
        Installing and restoring packagesets are very complex. This class needs work before it is
        generic for any set of packages. It currently hardcodes values that are specific to
        downloading subscription-manager and how we do that.

        Implementing it in a half-ready state because we need it to install and remove
        subscription-manager rpms at the right time relative to unregistering the system. As such,
        this class relies heavily on the implementation of downloading and installing
        subscription-manager. To make this generic, some pieces of that will need to move into
        this class:

        * Need a generic way to specify the UBI_X_REPO_PATH and UBI_X_REPO_CONTENT vars. Parameters
          to __init__?  Parameter to install pkgs from "symbolic name" (vendor, pre-rhel, rhel,
          enablerepos)? which we map to specific repo configurations?
        * Backup and restore the vendor versions of packages which are in update_pkgs.
        * Rename the global variables for SUBMGR_RPS_DIR, _RHSM_TMP_DIR, _UBI_7_REPO_CONTENT,
          _UBI_7_REPO_PATH, _UBI_8_REPO_CONTENT, _UBI_8_REPO_PATH to more generic names
        * Rename the helper functions: _download_rhsm_pkgs, _log_rhsm_download_directory_contents,
          exit_on_failed_download
        * Is the "We're using distro-sync" comment wrong?  We are using install, not distro-sync and
          git log never shows us using distro-sync.
        * This class is useful for package installation but not package removal. To replace backup.ChangedRPMPackagesController and back.RestorablePackage, we need to implement removal as well.  Should we do that here or in a second class?
          * Note: ChangedRPMPackagesController might still have code that deals with package replacement.  AFAIK, that can be removed entirely.  As of 1.4, there's never a time where we replace rpms and can restore them.  (Installing might upgrade dependencies from the vendor to other vendor packages).
        * Do we need to deal with dependency version issues?  With this code, if an installed dependency is an older version than the subscription-manager package we're installing needs to upgrade and the upgraded version is not present in the vendor's repo, then we will fail.
        * Do we want to filter already installed packages from the package_list in this function
          or leave it to the caller? If we leave it to the caller, then we need to backup vendor supplied previous files here and restore them on rollback. (Currently the
          caller handles this via subscription.needed_subscription_manager_pkgs().  This could cause problems if we need to do extra handling in enable/restore for packages which already exist on the system.)
        * Do we always want to pre-download the rpms and install from a directory of package files
          or do we sometimes want yum to download and install as one step? (Current caller
          doesn't care in subscription.install_rhel_subscription_manager().)
        * Why is system_info.is_rpm_installed() implemented in syste_info? Evaluate if it should be
          moved here.

    .. warn:: Some things that are not handled by this class:
        * Packages installed as a dependency on packages listed here will not be rolled back to the
          system default if we rollback the changes.
