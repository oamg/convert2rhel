#
# The #mirrorlist system uses the connecting IP address of the client and the
# update status of each mirror to pick current mirrors that are geographically
# close to the client.  You should use this for CentOS updates unless you are
# manually picking other mirrors.
#
# If the #mirrorlist does not work for you, you can try the commented out
# baseurl line instead.
#
# The Continuous Release (CR) repository contains packages for the next minor
# release of CentOS Linux.  This repository only has content in the time period
# between an upstream release and the official CentOS Linux release.  These
# packages have not been fully tested yet and should be considered beta
# quality.  They are made available for people willing to test and provide
# feedback for the next release.
