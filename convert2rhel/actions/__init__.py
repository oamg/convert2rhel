#: Status code of an Action.
#:
#: When an action completes, it may have succeeded or failed.  We set the
#: `Action.level` attribute to one of the following values so that we know
#: what happened.  This mapping lets us use a symbolic name for the level
#: for readability but that is mapped to a specific integer for consumption
#: by other tools.
#:
#: .. note:: At the moment, we only make use of SUCCESS and ERROR.  Other
#:      levels may be used in future releases as we refine this system
#:      and start to use it with console.redhat.com
#:
#: :SUCCESS: no problem.
#: :INFO: informational message to the user, no problem.
#: :WARNING: the problem is just a warning displayed to the user. (unused,
#:      warnings are currently emitted directly from the Action).
#: :SKIP: the action could not be run because a dependent Action failed.
#:      Actions should not return this. :func:`run_actions` will set this
#:      when it determines that an Action cannot be run due to dependencies
#:      having failed.
#: :OVERRIDABLE: the error caused convert2rhel to fail but the user has
#:      the option to ignore the check in a future run.
#: :ERROR: the error caused convert2rhel to fail the conversion, but further
#:      tests can be run.
#:
#: .. warning::
#:      * Do not change the numeric value of these levels once they
#:        have been in a public release as external tools may be depending on
#:        the value.
#:      * Actions should not set a level to ``SKIP``.  The code which
#:        runs the Actions will set this.
