        Resolve a yum transaction failure on OL8 related to the

        The iwl7260-firmware package causes a file conflict error while trying
        to replace it with its RHEL counterpart. The reason for this happening
        is that the iwlax2xx-firmware is an dependency package of
        iwl7260-firmware in OL8, but in the RHEL repositories, this dependency
        doesn't exist, all of the files that are available under the
        iwlax2xx-firmware package in OL8, are in fact, available in the
        iwl7260-firmware package in RHEL, thus, we are removing this depedency
        to not cause problems with the conversion anymore.
