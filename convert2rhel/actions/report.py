    """Output a summary regarding the actions execution.

    This summary is intended to be used to inform the user about the results
    reported by the actions.

    .. note:: Expected results format is as following
        {
            "$Action_id": {
                "status": int,
                "error_id": "$error_id",
                "message": "" or "$message"
            },
        }

    .. important:: Cases where the summary will be used
        * All action_id have results that are successes (best case possible)
            * If everything is a success, we just output a different message
                for the user.
        * Some action_id have results that are not successes (warnings, errors...)
            * For thoe cases, we only want to print whatever is higher than
                STATUS_CODE['WARNING']
            * If we print something, let's try to use the correct logger
                instead of just relying on `info`
            * If one of the status has no corresponding logger function, we
                should use just `info`

        The order of the message is from the highest priority (ERROR) to the
        lowest priority (WARNING).

        Message example's::
            * (ERROR) SubscribeSystem.ERROR: Error message
            * (SKIP) SubscribeSystem.SKIP: Skip message
            * (WARNING) SubscribeSystem.WARNING: Warning message

        In case of `message` being empty (as it is optional for some cases), a
        default message will be used::
            * (ERROR) SubscribeSystem.ERROR: [No further information given]

        In case of all actions executed without warnings or errors, the
        following message is used::
            * No problems detected during the analysis!

    :param results: Results dictionary as returned by :func:`run_actions`
    :type results: Mapping
    :param include_all_reports: If all reports should be logged instead of the
        highest ones.
