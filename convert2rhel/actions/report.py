        * All action_id have results that are successes (best case possible)
            * If everything is a success, we just output a different message
                for the user.
        * Some action_id have results that are not successes (warnings, errors...)
            * For thoe cases, we only want to print whatever is higher than
                STATUS_CODE['WARNING']
            * If we print something, let's try to use the correct logger
                instead of just relying on `info`
            * If one of the status has no corresponding logger function, we
                should use just `info`

        The order of the message is from the highest priority (FATAL) to the
        lowest priority (WARNING).

        Message example's::
            * (FATAL) SubscribeSystem.FATAL: Fatal error message
            * (ERROR) SubscribeSystem.ERROR: Error message
            * (SKIP) SubscribeSystem.SKIP: Skip message
            * (WARNING) SubscribeSystem.WARNING: Warning message

        In case of `message` being empty (as it is optional for some cases), a
        default message will be used::
            * (ERROR) SubscribeSystem.ERROR: [No further information given]

        In case of all actions executed without warnings or errors, the
        following message is used::
