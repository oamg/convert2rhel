        ..notes::
            The implementation of this yum transaction is different from the
            dnf one, mainly because yum can raise some "exceptions" while
            trying to resolve the dependencies of the transaction. Because of
            this, we need to loop through a couple of times until we know that
            all of the dependencies are resolved without problems.

            You might wonder "why not remove the packages that caused a
            failure and loop through the dep solving again?" Well. Since
            we are removing the problematic packages using `rpm` and not some
            specific method in the transaction itself, yum doesn't know that
            something has changed (The resolveDeps() function doesn't refresh
            if something else happens outside the transaction), in order to
            make sure that we won't have any problems with our transaction, it
            is easier to loop through everything again and just recreate the
            transaction, so yum will keep track of what's changed.

            This function should loop max 3 times to get to the point where our
            transaction doesn't have any problematic packages in there, and the
            subsequent transactions are "faster" because of some yum internal
            cache mechanism.

            This might be optimized in the future, but for now, it's somewhat
            reliable.
