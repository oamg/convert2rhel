def run_as_child_process(func):
    """Decorator to execute functions as child process.

    This decorator will use `multiprocessing.Process` class to initiate the
    function as a child process to the parent process with the intention to
    execute that in its own process, thus, avoiding cases where libraries would
    install signal handlers that could be propagated to the main thread if they
    do not do a proper clean-up.

    .. note::
        This decorator is mostly intended to be used when dealing with
        functions that call directly `rpm` or `yum`.

        In `rpm` (version 4.11.3, RHEL 7), it's known that whenever there is a
        call to that library, it will install a global signal handler catching
        different types of signals, but most importantly, the SIGINT (Ctrl + C)
        one, which causes a problem during the conversion as we can't replace
        or override that signal as it was initiated in a C library rather than
        a python library.

        By using this decorator, `rpm` will install the signal handler in the
        child process and leave the parent one with the original signal
        handling that is initiated by python itself (or, whatever signal is
        registered when the conversion starts as well).

    .. important::
        It is important to know that if a function is using this decorator,
        then it won't be possible for that function to spawn new child
        processes inside their workflow. This is a limitation imposed by the
        `daemon` property used to spawn the the first child process (the
        function being decorated), as it won't let a grandchild process being
        created inside an child process.
        For more information about that, refer to the Python Multiprocessing
        docs: https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Process.daemon

        For example::
            # A perfect normal function that spawn a child process
            def functionB():
                ...
                multiprocessing.Process(...)

            # If we want to use this decorator in `functionB()`, we would leave the child process of `functionB()` orphans when the parent process exits.
            @utils.run_as_child_process
            def functionB():
                ...
                multiprocessing.Process(...)
                ...

    Pexpect.spawn class that can set terminal size before starting process.

    This class is a workaround to the fact that pexpect-2.3 cannot officially set the terminal size
    until after the process is started.  On RHEL7, we use pexpect 2.3 along with yumdownloader.
    yundownloader checks the terminal size when it starts and then uses that terminal size for
    printing out its progress lines even if the size changes later.  This causes output to be
    truncated (losing information about the downloaded packages) because the line would be longer
    than the 80 columns which pexpect.spawn hardcodes as the startup value.

    Modern versions of pexpect (from 2015) fix this by giving spawn a dimensions() argument to set
    the startup terminal size.  We can emulate this by overriding the setwindowsize() function in
    a subclass through the use of a big kludge:

    pexpect-2.3's __init__() calls setwindowsize() to set the initial terminal size. If we
    override setwindowsize() to hardcode the dimensions that we pass in to the subclass's
    constructor prior to calling the base class's __init__(), pexpect will end up calling our
    overridden setwindowsize(), making the terminal the size that we want. If we then revert
    setwindowsize() back to the real function prior to returning from the subclass's __init__(),
    user's of the returned spawn object won't know that we temporarily overrode that method.

    # restructure this to raise an exception on error and have the caller
    # handle whether to use INCOMPLETE_ROLLBACK to do something for several
    # reasons:
    # (1) utils should be simple functions that take input and produce
    #     output from it. Having knowledge of things specific to the
    #     program (for instance, the environment variable that convert2rhel
    #     uses) makes the utils depend on the specific place that they are
    #     run instead.
    # (2) Where an error condition arises, they should "return" that to the
    #     caller to decide how to handle it by using an exception. Handling
    #     it inside the function ties us to one specific behaviour on
    #     error. (For instance, the incomplete rollback message here ties
    #     downloading packages and performing rollbacks. But what about
    #     downloading packages that are not tied to rollbacks. Maybe we
    #     have to download a package in order for insights or
    #     subscription-manager to run. In those cases, we either cannot use
    #     this function or we might show the user a misleading message).
    # (3) Functions in utils should be free of other dependencies within
    #     convert2rhel.  That allows us to use utils with no fear of
    #     circular dependency issues.
    # (4) Making the choices here mean that when used inside of the Action
    #     framework, we are limited to returning a FAILURE for the Action
    #     plugin whereas returning SKIP would be more accurate.
