        Single yum transaction validation

    description: |
        Verify that we are doing a proper rollback during the validation phase in
        our transactions.
        If any errors occurs during the transaction resolution, either by
        downloading a package, dependency resolver and etc., the rollback should
        start and revert the changes to the system.
        We simulate the error by removing the entitlement certs found at /etc/pki/entitlement
        at a specific times during the transaction validation.
